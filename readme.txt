--------------------------
It's 2011, when the dream begins. With supervision of Mr. Mustaque Sami, I was trained in WordPress and dreamt of a theme of my own. And then it's Ian Stewart, by whose tutorial a perfect WordPress theme knowledge started to grow. And then with the knowledge of graphics I made it.
